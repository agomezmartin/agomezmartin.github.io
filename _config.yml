about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Originally a Spanish national, I have lived in London for over a decade where I carried out both my studies and the onset of my professional career.
   
    Over the years, I have specialized as a <mark>Localization Engineer</mark> working for global <mark>Language Service Providers</mark> (LSPs), and gained extensive experience in preparing diverse file formats for translation, working with industry-leading Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools such as Wordfast, <mark>MemoQ</mark>, SDL Trados, and cloud-based platforms like <mark>XTM</mark>.

    In addition to working with Microsoft 365 and <mark>e-learning applications</mark>, I am passionate about engineering text files across multiple programming languages. My expertise includes developing custom <mark>parsers</mark>, <mark>regular expressions</mark>, and optimizing and automating processes through scripting, which enhances both the accuracy and speed of localization projects.

    Currently, I am working as a <mark>software developer</mark> in Madrid, Spain. However, I am eager to return to the localization industry, ideally in a client-side role within a dynamic and innovative environment. I am especially drawn to opportunities in the pharmaceutical sector, where I can apply my technical expertise to support critical global communications in a fast-paced, regulated industry.

          As a Localization Engineer at Acolad, I was responsible for the technical aspects of localization and translation projects, ensuring seamless adaptation of content for global markets. Key responsibilities included:

          - Software Localization: Managed the localization of software interfaces, ensuring proper internationalization and adaptation of UI/UX elements across multiple languages. Collaborated with developers to ensure seamless functionality post-localization.

          - e-Learning Localization: Assisted in the localization of e-learning courses, including the extraction of subtitles to Excel files and their conversion into SRT format after translation for seamless integration into training videos.

          - XML and DITA: Worked with XML and DITA formats to structure and manage documentation, ensuring content could be efficiently localized across different languages and regions.

          - Parsing and Regex: Employed parsing techniques and regular expressions (regex) to extract translatable content from various file formats, automate string extraction, and apply quality checks.

          - Localization Testing and QA: Performed functional and linguistic testing of localized content in software and e-learning environments to ensure proper functionality, cultural relevance, and high-quality user experience across different locales.

          Through this role, I strengthened my technical expertise in software localization, XML-based documentation, and e-learning content adaptation while contributing to the successful deployment of globalized products.
