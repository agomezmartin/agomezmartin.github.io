about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Originally a Spanish national, I have lived in London for over a decade where I carried out both my studies and the onset of my professional career.
    
    As a professional, I have developed mainly at global <mark>Language Service Providers</mark> (LSP) working as a <mark>Localization Engineer</mark>. Although coming from a translation-educated background, this position has enabled me to work hand-in-hand in the same department with IT-educated professionals where we came up together with solutions to streamline and scale the localization processes of our clients' software products.
    
    After having spent more than <mark>six years</mark> in the localization industry helping software clients localize (translate) their products, I am currently working as a Software Engineer for an Energy sector software company using <mark>C#</mark> and <mark>VBA</mark> programming languages.

            During my time at Gamesys, I was involved in the <mark>translation and localization</mark> of their <mark>HotShot Trader</mark> online video game project. The online video game was based in JavaScript and internationalized by extracting strings into JSON formatted files.
            This was an incredible opportunity to get my first professional contact with real software projects as I was just coming out of university.
